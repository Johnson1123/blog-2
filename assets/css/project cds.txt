The above CDS group members serving in Osogbo Local Government respectfully wish to request your support (in-kind and cash i.e financial support). 

The motive of our request before you is that, while we're diligently serving our father's land we also wish to carry out a project which will enhance the public awareness of our activities in the State by raising an NYSC flag at the Osogbo local government secretariat. 

As a member, we have equally levied ourselves to raise some funds, but to achieve success, we have decided to solicit your support from you as one of the personalities in the society.

 The project is not capital intensive, but it will involve spending money. The materials and cost evaluation for the project is listed below.
